Production-ready B2B e-commerce platform for Alfe Tissue Paper AB, showcasing enterprise-grade architecture and modern web development practices.

> ⚠️ **Project Context: ATP Store Integration**
>
> **Existing System:** Alfe Tissue Paper AB already has an internal frontend application used by their staff to create orders, dispatch lists, and invoice reminders. Client payments are tracked, reminders are sent to clients, and the inkasso process is managed through this system. Their frontend is connected to two backends: a Hasura GraphQL backend and a Nest.js REST API backend that serves as a mail server.
>
> **Our Contribution - ATP Store (This Repository):** We developed a comprehensive B2B e-commerce platform with dual functionality:
> - **Customer Portal**: Enables clients to browse products, create orders online, track their orders, monitor deliveries, and manage unpaid invoices through a dedicated customer dashboard
> - **Admin Portal**: Provides staff with comprehensive tools for product management, order processing, user administration, and business analytics through a separate admin dashboard
> - **Payment Integration**: Stripe integration has been implemented, though online payments are not currently accepted by the customer
>
> **Deployment Status:** The ATP Store customer portal has been completed and is production-ready. Product images are awaited to be deployed to the Hasura GraphQL backend by the customer. The launch is scheduled for September 1st, 2025. A staging version has been deployed for portfolio demonstration purposes with one fallback image.
