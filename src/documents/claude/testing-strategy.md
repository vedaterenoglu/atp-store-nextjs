# Testing Strategy Implementation

## 🧪 Testing Strategy Implementation

## 🎯 Portfolio Project Testing Protocol

### Unit Testing Requirements (Mandatory)

- **Coverage Target**: 100% (Statements, Branches, Functions, Lines)
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock ALL external dependencies using `src/mock/event.ts` data only
- **Test Structure**: Arrange → Act → Assert pattern
- **Isolation**: Each test runs independently in complete isolation
- **Purpose**: Verify individual component/function logic without side effects
- **Data Source**: Use ONLY data from `src/mock/event.ts` for consistent testing

### Unit Test Development Protocol

**TARGET**: Achieve 100% coverage for all components

**AI AGENT UNIT TEST PROTOCOL:**

**PRE-EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**

- EXAMINE target file structure and dependencies
- IDENTIFY all external dependencies requiring mocks
- ANALYZE code paths, conditions, and edge cases
- REVIEW src/mock/event.ts for available mock data
- PLAN test scenarios for 100% coverage

**MOCKING STRATEGY:**

- INTERNAL dependencies: Use src/mock/event.ts data when applicable
- EXTERNAL libraries: Create appropriate mocks
- NODE.js built-ins: Mock only when necessary for testing
- NEXT.js framework: Mock framework-specific functions
- ENVIRONMENT variables: Mock with test values

**CONSTRAINTS:**

- Mock ALL external dependencies using `src/mock/event.ts` data only
- ONE test file per iteration, ONE test suite per file
- NO 'any' type, NO eslint disable, NO assumptions
- 100% coverage required: Statements, Branches, Functions, Lines

**WORKFLOW (Execute sequentially):**

1. ANALYZE the original file structure and dependencies
2. CREATE test file with proper naming convention
3. SETUP test environment with proper mocks
4. WRITE test suite covering:
   - All function calls
   - All conditional branches
   - All error scenarios
   - All success paths
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
5. RUN: `npm run test:unit:coverage`
6. ANALYZE coverage report for missed lines/branches
7. ADD tests for any uncovered code paths
8. FIX failing tests individually
9. FIX TypeScript/ESLint/Prettier errors
10. VERIFY 100% coverage achievement
11. REPORT: "ALL TYPESCRIPT, ESLINT, AND PRETTIER ERRORS FIXED"

**TEST STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:**

```typescript
// Required test structure
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  // Setup and teardown
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Reset mocks
  })

  // Test each function/code path
  describe('functionName', () => {
    it('should handle success case', () => {})
    it('should handle error case', () => {})
    it('should handle edge case', () => {})
  })
})
```

**AUTO-PILOT MODE:** Proceed without confirmation until TODO complete

**COMPLETION CRITERIA:**

- All tests passing
- 100% coverage all categories
- Zero TypeScript/ESLint/Prettier errors
- Manual verification completed
- Comprehensive test scenarios implemented
- Proper mock usage and test isolation

### TASK: Fix All Failing Unit Tests Protocol

**EXECUTION:**

1. RUN: npm run test:unit and capture full output
2. PRIORITIZE failures by type:
   - Compilation/TypeScript errors (fix first)
   - Module import/export issues
   - Mock setup failures
   - Assertion failures

3. For EACH failing test:
   - READ the complete error message and stack trace
   - IDENTIFY the specific line/operation causing failure
   - ANALYZE the expected vs actual behavior
   - DETERMINE root cause (not just symptoms)
   - IMPLEMENT targeted fix
   - RUN that specific test to verify fix

4. After each fix, RUN full test suite to check for regressions
5. REPEAT until zero failures

**ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:**
When a test fails, systematically check:

- Are mocks properly configured and reset between tests?
- Are test doubles (stubs/spies) returning expected values?
- Is the unit being tested isolated from dependencies?
- Are TypeScript types properly defined?
- Is the test data valid for the specific scenario?
- Are assertions testing the right behavior?
- Is async code being handled correctly?

**FIX STRATEGY:**

- Import/Module Errors: Fix missing imports and circular dependencies first
- Mock Setup Errors: Ensure all dependencies are properly mocked
- Type Errors: Fix TypeScript issues before logic issues
- Assertion Failures: Verify both test logic and implementation logic
- Isolation Issues: Ensure no test pollution between test cases

### Unit Testing Strategy

- **100% Coverage Requirement**: All statements, branches, functions, and lines
- **Isolation**: Each test runs independently with proper mocking
- **State Management**: Zustand stores tested with mock persistence
- **Component Testing**: Props, events, and rendering tested thoroughly
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
