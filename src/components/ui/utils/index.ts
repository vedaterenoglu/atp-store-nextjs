/**
 * UI Utilities Barrel Export
 *
 * SOLID Principles Applied:
 * - SRP: Single responsibility for utility function exports
 * - OCP: Open for extension with new utility functions
 * - ISP: Provides focused interface for UI utilities
 *
 * Design Patterns:
 * - Barrel Export Pattern: Consolidates utility exports
 * - Utility Pattern: Common functions for UI components
 *
 * Architecture: Central export point for UI utility functions,
 * providing common helpers for component styling and behavior

// Export all utilities from utils.ts
